###Music

If you're looking for some music to play whilst carving away at this problem you *think* is difficult, I recommend some progressive piano music like [**Rammstein's XXI Klavier**](https://play.spotify.com/album/6rK4qSVdrNCNnQwRCEFsw9), however this music approach may not help some in which case I recommend the sweet sounds of silence.
